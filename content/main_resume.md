## Experience

### Software Development Engineer, Amazon Web Services (Aug 2022 - Present)
- Designed and delivered high-scale, security-first features for AWS Systems Manager, serving a customer base of 100,000+ and leveraging Java, Golang, TypeScript, and AWS services (S3, CloudFormation, IAM, DynamoDB, EC2, CloudWatch, SQS, SNS).
- Led a 14-month project to build an AWS SSM microservice in 7 isolated ISO-certified regions, requiring close coordination with multiple engineers with ISO access and bringing AWS services in ISO regions up to parity with commercial regions.
- Built an additional UI component in the service's AWS web console for accessing the SSM Documents API (AWS SDK, TypeScript, React, Jest, Sinon).
- Optimized the AWS SSM Session Manager microservice's ability to stream to AWS CloudWatch Logs in real time (Golang).
- Reduced the AWS SSM Health microservice’s region expansion time from 2 months to 2 weeks by creating comprehensive, standardized documentation that streamlined the process for 3 new regions.
- Transitioned the service's region expansion efforts from a manual process to an automated zero-touch approach, saving ~100 man-hours per new region (CloudFormation, IAM, internal CI/CD tools).
