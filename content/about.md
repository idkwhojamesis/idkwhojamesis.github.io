# *welcome*
Hi, I'm James! I mainly do front-end web stuff. I recently graduated from Fordham with a BA in New Media and Digital Design and I'm now one semester into an MS in Comp Sci *(currently taking a year off)*. 

I'm on a lifelong mission to learn everything I can to improve people's lives, express myself, and better understand how technology has transformed humanity. 

Currently, I'm focused on studying for the GRE so I can apply to other grad schools. Otherwise I've been taking a break from my recent web-app project as I re-evaluate what to do with it ðŸ˜…
