# *welcome*
Hi, I'm James! I mainly do front-end web stuff. I recently graduated from Fordham with a BA in New Media and Digital Design and I'm now one semester into an MS in Comp Sci *(currently taking a year off)*. 

I'm on a lifelong mission to learn everything I can to improve people's lives, express myself, and better understand how technology has transformed humanity. 

Currently, I'm studying for interviews and building an app that eliminates the repetition of resume creation and per-job tailoring. I just accepted my admission to Georgia Tech's Master in CS, but also looking for work so I can expand my options for what exactly I want to do next year.

Contact: (hmu with job offers and/or contract work! I'll take anything interesting and within my means)
