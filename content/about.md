Hi, I'm James Park (he/him).

I'm on a lifelong mission to learn everything I can to improve people's lives, express myself, and better understand how technology transforms humanity.

Currently, I am working at Amazon Web Services as an SDE (now looking for new work!), in my spare time I experiment with game development and engage in community organizing.

Feel free to check out my portfolio, resume, and blog on here, although since I'm mostly focused on work I haven't made anything new in a while.
