Hi, I'm James Park - he/him.

I'm on a lifelong mission to learn everything I can to improve people's lives, express myself, and better understand how technology transforms humanity.

Currently, I'm excited to say that I will be starting as an SDE at Amazon Web Services in August. I will also be taking a class at Georgia Tech OMSCS (hoping to get into Human-Computer Interaction) and I also want to make time to learn Unreal Engine 5.
