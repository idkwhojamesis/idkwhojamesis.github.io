# *welcome*
Hi, I'm James! I mainly do front-end web stuff. I recently graduated from Fordham with a BA in New Media and Digital Design and I'm now one semester into an MS in Comp Sci (*edit: currently taking a year off*). I'm learning how to code so I can improve people's lives, make the web fun again, and better understand how the web is (and has been) transforming our world. 

Currently, I'm working on building my [Portfolio](/portfolio/) and finishing an app that eliminates the repetition of resume creation and per-job tailoring.

Check out some small games I've made / helped make [on my itch.io page](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/).

Contact: (hmu with job offers and/or contract work! I'll take pretty much anything interesting)
