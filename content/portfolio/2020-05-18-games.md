# Portfolio

Some games and prototypes I have made or helped make. 

All of these can be played on my [**itch.io page.**](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/)

**Novel and experimental game mechanics** are my main interests and biggest pool of ideas. My favorite game of all time is Portal (the original, not 2) and from some of these concepts you can probably see the inspiration.

## "...as tensions rise" (2021)

For GMTK Game Jam 2021: "Joined Together". You are watching the perspective of an aerial news crew as they broadcast a mass gathering in front of a corporate building. 
This project uses Babylon's Solid Particle System to depict a lively crowd that can rapidly increase in population.

Final group project for a Game Design Projects class.

A girl and her dog look too far into the mysterious connection between her parents and the monster in the basement. We were assigned to make a project surrounding a serious topic, and this project deals with the trauma of parental emotional abuse and alcoholism.

Team:
Julia Sparago - concept, story, level design, dialogue  
Kyle Horstmann  - topic research and interviews, dialogue

Final project for an Intro to Game Narrative class.

Two friends have to fight each other for their freedom. Change the outcome with your actions to unlock 7 different endings.

Thank you to Prof. Chris Vicari and the class for a fun semester (despite the pandemic cutting it short)! Also, shoutout to my friend Kevin for extensive and extremely helpful QA.

Team submission for 2020 Playcrafting Global Game Jam NYC. I did audioMixer programming and some bug fixing. 

After a majestic penguin statue is blown to bits, you must pick up its limbs and put it back together. How exactly these limbs are arranged, however, is up to you...

Team:  
[Paul Blieka](https://degugames.itch.io/) - lead programmer  
[Joel Sanchez](https://www.artstation.com/joel0827) - art, modeling, post-processing

[Play in browser (requires keyboard+mouse) (demo)](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/telegolf)  

Navigate courses and find secrets with a golf ball that can teleport you to its location. Planning to turn this into a full game, although admittedly progress as been slow as I am struggling to design interesting levels around this mechanic.
