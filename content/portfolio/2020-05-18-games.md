# Portfolio

Some games and prototypes I have made or helped make. 

All of these can be played on my [**itch.io page.**](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/)

In Winter 2018 I took more than a thousand pictures of "The Marketplace at Factoria", a small mall in Bellevue, WA near where I grew up, intending to reconstruct the main interior of the mall using photogrammetry and create a real-time walking experience. After my first attempt in 2019 using RealityCapture was mostly a failure, I tried again in 2024 using a new reconstruction technique called Gaussian Splats using [Nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/nerfology/methods/splat.html). This still turned out pretty bad and I realized that the data I gathered back then was insufficient, but splats are at least optimized enough to be rendered in an Unreal app using the [Luma AI plugin](https://lumalabs.ai/ue). You can try it above, and I also provided the project folder if you're curious.

## heaviest hammer (2022)

For itch's Mini Game Jam 100: "Chaos". Super janky, but the main idea is the use of a weapon that charges in power by shaking your mouse as hard as you can. I used Unity 2019 for this one.

## "...as tensions rise" (2021)

For GMTK Game Jam 2021: "Joined Together". You are watching the perspective of an aerial news crew as they broadcast a mass gathering in front of a corporate building. 
This project uses Babylon's Solid Particle System to depict a lively crowd that can rapidly increase in population.

Final group project for a Game Design Projects class.

A girl and her dog look too far into the mysterious connection between her parents and the monster in the basement. We were assigned to make a project surrounding a serious topic, and this project deals with the trauma of parental emotional abuse and alcoholism.

Julia Sparago - concept, story, level design, dialogue  
Kyle Horstmann  - topic research and interviews, dialogue

Final project for an Intro to Game Narrative class.

Two friends have to fight each other for their freedom. Change the outcome with your actions to unlock 7 different endings.

Thank you to Prof. Chris Vicari and the class for a fun semester (despite the pandemic cutting it short)! Also, shoutout to my friend Kevin for extensive and extremely helpful QA.

Team submission for 2020 Playcrafting Global Game Jam NYC. I did audioMixer programming and some bug fixing. 

After a majestic penguin statue is blown to bits, you must pick up its limbs and put it back together. How exactly these limbs are arranged, however, is up to you...

Team:  
[Paul Blieka](https://degugames.itch.io/) - lead programmer  
[Joel Sanchez](https://www.artstation.com/joel0827) - art, modeling, post-processing  
[Robert Karpay](https://www.robertkarpay.com) - music  
Mike Thompson - UI  
me - adaptive audio programming, bug fixing

![telegolf screenshot](/assets/portfolio/telegolf-gif.gif)

[Play in browser (requires keyboard+mouse) (demo)](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/telegolf)  

Navigate courses and find secrets with a golf ball that can teleport you to its location. Planning to turn this into a full game, although admittedly progress as been slow as I am struggling to design interesting levels around this mechanic.
