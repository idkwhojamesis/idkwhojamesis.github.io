Some games and prototypes I have made or helped make. 

All of these can be played on my [**itch.io page.**](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/)

**Novel and experimental game mechanics** are my main interests and biggest pool of ideas. My favorite game of all time is Portal (the original, not 2) and from some of these concepts you can probably see the inspiration.

## Telegolf (2019 - on pause)

[Play in browser (requires keyboard+mouse) (demo)](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/telegolf)  

Navigate courses and find secrets with a golf ball that can teleport you to its location. Planning to turn this into a full game, although admittedly progress as been slow as I am struggling to design interesting levels around this mechanic.

Team submission for 2020 Playcrafting Global Game Jam NYC. I did audioMixer programming and some bug fixing. 

After a majestic penguin statue is blown to bits, you must pick up its limbs and put it back together. How exactly these limbs are arranged, however, is up to you...

Final project for an Intro to Game Narrative class.

Two friends have to fight each other for their freedom. Change the outcome with your actions to unlock 7 different endings.

Thank you to Prof. Chris Vicari and the class for a fun semester (despite the pandemic cutting it short)! Also, shoutout to my friend Kevin for extensive and extremely helpful QA.
