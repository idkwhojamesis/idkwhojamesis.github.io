# welcome!
I'm an undergrad studying New Media and Digital Design at Fordham University, soon to be a Masters CS grad student at Fordham GSAS. My lifelong interest and passion is in game design, but really my current area of focus depends on the latest project idea I'm working on.

Expect me to post in the [Updates]({% link main_updates.html %}) section about progress on projects, as well as any kind of observation on games, culture, style/aesthetics, music, or any train of thought best expressed in blog form. 

I have some small games you can check out [on my itch.io page](https://idkwhojamesis.itch.io/).

*EMPLOYERS and RECRUITERS:* Check out the [Resume]({% link main_resume.md %}) and [Portfolio]({% link main_portfolio.html %}) sections to learn more about me.

Thanks for stopping by!
